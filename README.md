# nixos-ceph-benaco

This repo is the open-source dump of the NixOS Ceph package, service module, and auto-bootstrapping modules that we'd eventually like to consolidate with / merge into the upstream [`nixpkgs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) Ceph modules (which were written around the same time as we wrote ours).

The contents are not fully runnable, but should give a good idea of how our module works and is supposed to be used.
